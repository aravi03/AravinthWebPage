    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, either with superpowers or other special characteristics. 
        Its purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America,
        they worked with the peaceful interests of the whole world in mind rather than a specific country or organization. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D.
