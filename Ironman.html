            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, 
            and the former CEO of Stark Industries, a company originally started by his father, Howard Stark. 
            A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist. 
            With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men, 
            and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. 
            With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as his traitorous business associate Obadiah Stane.
             Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly announcing himself as Iron Man.

             &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his legacy. Due to their assistance in both these battles, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with Pepper Potts. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and help him retire.
